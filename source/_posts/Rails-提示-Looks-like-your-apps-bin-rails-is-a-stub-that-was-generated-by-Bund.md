###### 无缘无故的输入rails相关指令出现了一大堆tips，目前还没有影响运行，但是看着很不爽。

```
Looks like your app's ./bin/rails is a stub that was generated by Bundler.

In Rails 5, your app's bin/ directory contains executables that are versioned
like any other source code, rather than stubs that are generated on demand.

Here's how to upgrade:

  bundle config --delete bin    # Turn off Bundler's stub generator
  rails app:update:bin          # Use the new Rails 5 executables
  git add bin                   # Add bin/ to source control

You may need to remove bin/ from your .gitignore as well.
```

###### 尝试按照其中的提示解决这个问题

输入如下指令
```
rails app:update:bin
```

问题完美解决了。
